# India's World Cup Winning Streak Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Untitled2.ipynb" which performs data analysis on India's World Cup winning streak in cricket. The analysis is based on historical cricket match data and focuses on matches from 2007 onwards involving major cricket-playing countries.

## Code Reference
The provided code in the notebook "Untitled2.ipynb" performs the following tasks:

1. Imports match data from a Google Drive link.
2. Pre-processes the data, including converting date columns to a proper date format.
3. Filters the data to include matches from the year 2007 and onwards.
4. Focuses on major cricket-playing countries, specifically 'Afghanistan,' 'Australia,' 'Bangladesh,' 'England,' 'India,' 'New Zealand,' 'Pakistan,' 'South Africa,' 'Sri Lanka,' 'West Indies,' and 'Zimbabwe.'
5. Calculates and aggregates match statistics for each team, including the number of matches played, the number of wins, and the win percentage.
6. Visualizes the win percentages of select teams over time.
